Bootstrap_Financial_Portfolio:
"""
Estimating the variance in the data using Bootstrap. 

Implementing Parallel Processing using Multiprocessing package.

Portfolio dataset containing returns of two assets X and Y.
Objective is to estimate ratio of investment f/(1-f) between the two for minimizing risk of investment.
Considering the variance in X and Y, the objective function is to minimize Variance (fX + (1-f)Y).

f is a function of variance of X, Y and XY (refer to book below).
